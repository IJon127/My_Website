      "Urban images have been prevailing and even ubiquitous these days. We see representations of cities in digital maps, movies or games, and we often participate in creating urban imageries by posting traveling logs in social media, uploading panorama shots or creating computer game MUDs based on real life locations. However, in terms of actual interaction instead of visual or virtual participation, it is much more difficult to create public engagement in any built urban environment. The more designers and architects put effort into applying complicated algorithms and mechanisms to interactive items, the more it shows that the majority of our surroundings, by its default status, do not interact with people at all.",
      "All Colors Are In The Lights (ACAITL) is an installation that animates the environment via arrangements of images and projections. Without complicated sensing techniques or movable mechanisms, an intuitive light and shadow show with everyday street view images creates an instantly relatable urban experience to the audience. A playful and responsive engagement between an enclosed interior and an open urban spatial environment is presented in a way that invites maximum public participation, whether to interact with the imagery, the projections, or the interior space, individually as well as collectively."

      "Zooba is a competitive and educational 2 player rhythm game that is based on studies and hypotheses of the link between vocal learning and vocal entrainment (dance) in various species.",
      "You are given a selection of animals to choose from based on 6 categories: speed, vocal, power, auditory, beauty, and vision—with the prompt: “be the next dance champion”. Each animal will activate its own unique game pattern and all animals are ranked based on quantitative datasets from 0 to 5, with 5 being best, and 0 being worst.",
      "The game includes 2 distinct stages within a song: Stage 1, both players are given the same rhythm game (beats) that are created to match the rhythm of the song perfectly. Stage 2, based on which animal a player chose, beats are presented based on how animals would dance to a rhythm. By playing the rhythm game as if being the animal, players can sense and experience how the selected animal perceives and reacts to rhythm and beats."

      "Tree Shadow Lamp is a roly-poly table lamp for meditation. It is inspired by the soothing nature of tree shadows. The lamp connects with a p5 sketch projected in the space. When people gently sway the lamp, the internal accelerometer will generate data for the p5 sketch to trigger the animation and sound.",
      "There are three LED bulbs in the lamp. Each bulb connects to the Arduino 33 IoT build-in gyroscope’s X, Y, and Z values, respectively. The three shadow videos and the sound of leaves rustling in the P5 sketch are also linked to the gyroscope data; when the gyroscope detects axial motion, the opacity of the videos and the volume of sound increase. Likewise, while the movement stops, the opacity and volume decline."

This project focuses on the Kinesthetics/Sensory and the Perceptual/ Affective levels of the ETC framework.",
      "Participants will wear a special glove on their dominant hand to paint on the virtual canvas by clicking the thumb with the index finger. Inside the middle finger of the glove is a forcing sensor that controls the radius of the spray. The tighter the fist grasped, the smaller the spray range. A color palette and a color picker are in front of the canvas. People move the color picker to take the color for the spray.",
      "Except for the canvas, an auto-generated report behind the scene will analyze the creative process by assessing the composition of the color, the proportion of the blank space on the canvas, the color choice by time, how long you have held tightly, and how tight, etc. Then, while participants finish their drawing and press the \"done\" button, The report will show on the screen."

Meanwhile, the wooden columns constitute a fence of the site. The restaurant is the only part opened to the public. It has been lifted up to the second floor. Then customers in the restaurant can have great view of the bicycle path."

      "Earthquakes, typhoons and volcanoes constantly ravage coastal regions around the globe. Countless schools take the brunt of this destructive force, but simultaneously act as emergency operation centers and shelters after the disaster. Unfortunately, the collapse of this infrastructure hinders relief operations. In response to this potentially dire situation, we’ve developed a new system which can be quickly constructed with on-hand materials and readily transported to damaged environments.",
      "Often the stricken area is inaccessible by vehicles, so aid organizations airdrop relief supplies by helicopter. Our design incorporates the containers and other transportation materials (sack bags, canvas, and mesh) as components of the construction.",
      "The building is divided into three parts: first-floor load bearing walls, a second floor made of mesh, and a roof. The first floor utilizes two forms of wall: one constituted by bags filled with readily available mud, rubble or debris, the other composed of used bottles. These walls not only form space on the ground floor but are also erected to act as the structure supporting the mesh layer. Due to the unpredictability of aftershocks, the building design foregoes a heavy roof. Instead, the roof is made from the original canvas used to package emergency supplies."

The second timeline describes the life cycle of bamboo. In Taiwan, bamboo could take three years to grow into viable building material, and various preservation treatments take varying amounts of time. Lastly, a construction timeline is designed to integrate the former two phases, aligning the rehab treatment procedure with the cycle of nature."
